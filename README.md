# ShopEase Sales Insights (Week 1 Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed during my Data Analysis Internship at **Victoria Solutions Consulting (London)**.  
The objective was to analyze sales data from **ShopEase**, an online retail company, to improve sales performance and customer satisfaction.  

The project focused on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and generating actionable business recommendations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the raw dataset (remove duplicates, handle missing values, fix inconsistent formats).  
- Perform **EDA** to identify seasonal patterns, top product categories, and customer purchasing behaviors.  
- Create **visualizations** to communicate insights effectively (line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, regional sales).  
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve sales strategies and decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, pivot tables, summary statistics, correlation analysis.  
- **Power Query** – Column profiling, quality checks, formatting.  
- **Visualization** – Line, bar, heatmap, and regional sales dashboards.

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Line chart:** Monthly sales trends (Jan–Jun 2024).  
- **Bar chart:** Sales by product category (Electronics, Clothing, Books).  
- **Heatmap:** Correlations between Quantity, Price, and Sales.  
- **Regional analysis:** Sales across East, West, North, and South by payment method.  
- **Customer-level analysis:** Identified top spenders (C002 with £1,200) and lowest spenders (C007 with £25).

## ✅ Recommendations
- Set and monitor **monthly sales targets** to reduce seasonal fluctuations.  
- Increase inventory for **best-selling products** (e.g., Smartphones, Tablets).  
- Investigate underperforming categories (Books, Clothing) and gather customer feedback to improve offerings.  
- Diversify **payment methods** across all regions to match customer preferences.  
- Apply successful seasonal sales strategies (e.g., promotions during Jan & Jun) to weaker months.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
- Anonymize customer data before sharing.  
- Mitigate bias by checking for imbalances in datasets.  
- Obtain consent from customers before using their data.  
- Secure sensitive data with encryption and controlled access.
